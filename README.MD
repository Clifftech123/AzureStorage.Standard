# Azure Storage Standard Library

This library provides a set of standard APIs for interacting with Azure Storage services, including Blob Storage, Queue Storage, and Table Storage. It aims to simplify the development process by offering a consistent programming model and a rich set of features for managing cloud-based storage resources. This provides you methods for common tasks such as uploading and downloading files, managing metadata, and handling access control.

# Problem that this Library Solves
Working with Azure Storage services can be complex due to the variety of APIs and SDKs available. Developers often find themselves writing similar code for different services, leading to increased development time and potential errors. This library aims to streamline the process by providing a unified API surface and a consistent programming model across all Azure Storage services.

With this library, developers can focus on building their applications without worrying about the underlying complexities of each storage service. The library abstracts away the differences between services, allowing for a more intuitive and efficient development experience.

You can call the library's methods to perform common tasks such as uploading and downloading files, managing metadata, and handling access control without writing the same boilerplate code for each service.
